# Smart Academic Planner & Course Clash Detector 🧠📅

This project is a JavaFX-based desktop application designed to help university students generate conflict-free course schedules, with built-in prerequisite validation and optional AI support.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Add courses with custom days and time slots  
- ✅ Automatic detection of time conflicts  
- ✅ Prerequisite validation using MySQL  
- ✅ Weekly schedule table visualization  
- ✅ Optional AI integration using LM Studio (e.g., MythoMax)  
- ✅ Fallback backtracking algorithm if AI is unavailable  

## 🧠 AI Integration (Optional)

If LM Studio is running locally with a model like MythoMax, the app sends a natural language prompt describing the user's selected courses and possible time slots.  
The AI responds with a human-readable schedule suggestion.

If LM Studio is not running, the app automatically switches to a backtracking algorithm to generate the best possible non-conflicting schedule.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java 17  
- JavaFX  
- MySQL  
- JDBC  
- LM Studio / MythoMax (optional)  
- MVC Architecture
